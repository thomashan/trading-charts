# trading-charts
JavaFX implementation of trading charts

## Prerequisites
* java 11+

## Design consideration
* Keep to the basics and keep it simple!
* Process massive amounts of data and plot it!

## Limitation
* No JPMS (java platform module system) support.
Currently gradle does not have any JavaFX plugin and module plugin which works seamlessly.
We plan to use JPMS  once gradle provide stable versions of plugin.
