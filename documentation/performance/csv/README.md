# CSV
We check the performance to read 3,000,000 csv rows (excluding headers).

For the test data with 5S time-frame that equates to around 9 months of worth of data.
```
number of seconds = 3,000,000 * 5 = 15,000,000
number of minutes = 15,000,000 / 60 = 250,000
number of hours = 250,000 / 60 = 4,166.66
number of days = 4,166.66 / 24 = 173.61
number of months = 173.61 / 20 = 8.6805
```
